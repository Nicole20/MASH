MASH
====

MASH is a game that girls would play in elementary. They would have lots of fun "predicting" their future. There are many different versions and categories. Mine would predict who you'll marry, what car you'll drive, how many kids you'll have, and whether you'll live in a Mansion, Apartment, Shack (or Sewer), or a House.
